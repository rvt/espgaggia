# Design Goal
A make a gaggia coffee machine more smart and make it such that is would be easy to duplicate with least amouth of soldering.

Features
* Control temperature of both stream and brew and set temperature with a touch display (Fuzzy Logic)
* pre-infuse your coffee
* Make recipes using a simple scripting language with menu's controle brew/preinfuse timings and temperatures
* Standby + Remote turn on (Using MQTT and SIRI)
* Deep sleep option (work in progress)
* Stand by and power down options with a lower temperature to conserve energy.

# Word Of Warning

### Please read this carefull!

If you are going to build this project you have to understand you will be working with dangerous voltages and high temperatures! Although I did my best to use standard components that I think are reliable, I cannot be held responsible for any damages to your machine, yourself or the surroundings in any way possible.

# Compilation

```bash
rvt$ pio run
Processing gaggia (platform: espressif32; framework: arduino; board: esp32dev)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verbose mode can be enabled via `-v, --verbose` option

```

To upload to your wemos device run the following command (OSX):
```platformio run --target upload -e gaggia```
```platformio run --target uploadfs -e gaggia```

For other compiler options check `config.hpp` and `platformio.ini` for other options. 

# Configuration

The device will use the know wifi network or it wil present itself as a WIFI accesspoint using a wifimanager. Just connect to that accesspoint and open a browser to configure WIFI andf MQTT.
By default it will have some scripts to do some of it's work. Check the data directory that is almost self explanatory on how it works.

# MQTT Messages

Messages can be send as simple string (properties format) or as JSON.


```json
{
    "tempBrew":49.50,
    "tempSteam":50.00,
    "setPoint":10.00,
    "boiler":0.00,
    "brewBut":0,
    "steamBut":0,
    "pump":0,
    "valve":0
}
```

# Scripting

See data directory for examples (this is still work in progress, but it works right now well enough for me to beabke to publish, however they are subject to change.

# Hardware and Connection

* Assorted silicon wires that can handle the current, like XXAWG for the heat element (for 230V Gaggia), the rest can be XXAWG 
* HLK-PM01 230 -> 5VDC power supply https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32408565688.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.13984c4dg0pb5v

note: For the MAX31855K make sure you get the 'fancy' one, that is proper dialectric consensator, NOT the one with just two components

# Homebridge

JSON COnfiguration for homebrige so you can turn on and off the machine with SIRI.
`ID OF ESP32` is in the form of `XXXXXXXX`. Use a tool like http://mqtt-explorer.com to see the messages
